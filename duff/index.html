                <p>The quality of Duff is the standard for mass quantity supply beer. Strict regulations are supposedly maintained at Quality Assurance. Such a foothold for good supply may be the only filter as portions of Duff Beer contaminated by rats, body parts and even Hitler's head have been spotted. Duff was endorsed during the Kennedy/Nixon debates by Kennedy, an idea that was then stolen by Nixon when he also tried to declare his support for 'that particular beer (which no one believed for a moment).Duff original design Duff's design in its first appearance. Homer had even been buying it in the past when he was seventeen years old using a fake ID. He even sang about it in "Duffless" with the short musical number "When I Was Seventeen". </p>
